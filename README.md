Java divides the   into the following groups:
	• Arithmetic operators<br>
	• Assignment operators
	• Comparison operators
	• Logical operators
	• Bitwise operators

Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic operators are used to perform common mathematical operations.
Operator	Name	Description	Example	Try it
+	Addition	Adds together two values	x + y	Try it »
-	Subtraction	Subtracts one value from another	x - y	Try it »
*	Multiplication	Multiplies two values	x * y	Try it »
/	Division	Divides one value by another	x / y	Try it »
%	Modulus	Returns the division remainder	x % y	Try it »
++	Increment	Increases the value of a variable by 1	++x	Try it »
-- 	Decrement	Decreases the value of a variable by 1	--x	Try it »

Java Assignment Operators
Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.
In the example below, we use the assignment operator (=) to assign the value 10 to a variable called x:
Example
intx =10;
Try it Yourself »
The addition assignment operator (+=) adds a value to a variable:
Example
intx =10;x +=5;
Try it Yourself »
A list of all assignment operators:
Operator	Example	Same As	Try it
=	x = 5	x = 5	Try it »
+=	x += 3	x = x + 3	Try it »
-=	x -= 3	x = x - 3	Try it »
*=	x *= 3	x = x * 3	Try it »
/=	x /= 3	x = x / 3	Try it »
%=	x %= 3	x = x % 3	Try it »
&=	x &= 3	x = x & 3	Try it »
|=	x |= 3	x = x | 3	Try it »
^=	x ^= 3	x = x ^ 3	Try it »
>>=	x >>= 3	x = x >> 3	Try it »
<<=	x <<= 3	x = x << 3	Try it »

Java Comparison Operators
Comparison operators are used to compare two values:
Operator	Name	Example	Try it
==	Equal to	x == y	Try it »
!=	Not equal	x != y	Try it »
>	Greater than	x > y	Try it »
<	Less than	x < y	Try it »
>=	Greater than or equal to	x >= y	Try it »
<=	Less than or equal to	x <= y	Try it »

Java Logical Operators
Logical operators are used to determine the logic between variables or values:
Operator	Name	Description	Example	Try it
&& 	Logical and	Returns true if both statements are true	x < 5 &&  x < 10	Try it »
|| 	Logical or	Returns true if one of the statements is true	x < 5 || x < 4	Try it »
!	Logical not	Reverse the result, returns false if the result is true	!(x < 5 && x < 10)	Try it »
